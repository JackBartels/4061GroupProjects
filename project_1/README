Lee- I worked on the warmup, build function, and debugged a few issues in the depend_are_newer and the command line input handler. 
Joe - I worked on checking timestamps, file existance, and a few bugs in the warmup.
Jack - I worked on specified targets, -f flag implementation, and some error handling.

void build(target_t* basetarget, target_t* target, int nTargetCount): Function that recursively calls build on each dependancy in
the DAG of the target that is passed. It calls the function does_file_exist to check if file exist. If the file does not exist it 
continue to build. It calls the function depend_are_newer to check timestamps. If dependencies are newer than it will continue to build.
To build the function creates a new process using fork(). Within the child process, it calls parse_into_tokens to tokenize the input
string. it then uses execvp() to execute the command of the target that was tokenized. 

int depend_are_newer(target_t *target): Function to check the target's modification timestamp with the target's dependencies timestamps.
If any of the dependencies have been modified more recent than the target, return 1 to proceed with build function.
If the target is more recent than all dependencies, target is up to date, no need to recompile, return 0.
